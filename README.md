## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation courses influence the test scores of students. By understanding these relationships, educators and policymakers can make informed decisions to improve student performance.

## Motivation

Student performance is a critical indicator of educational effectiveness. Understanding the underlying factors that affect performance can lead to targeted interventions and improved outcomes. This project seeks to identify and quantify the impact of different variables on student test scores.

## Data Description

The dataset includes information on the following variables:
- **Gender**: The gender of the student (Male/Female)
- **Ethnicity**: The ethnic background of the student (grouped into categories)
- **Parental Level of Education**: The highest education level attained by the student's parents
- **Lunch**: The type of lunch received by the student (standard/reduced)
- **Test Preparation Course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (none/completed)
- **Test Scores**: The scores achieved by the student in exams (Math, Reading, Writing)

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-analysis.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd student-performance-analysis
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To analyze the data and generate results, run the following command:

```bash
python analyze.py
```

This script will perform the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. Results will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Modeling Approach

The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict student performance based on the features provided. The steps include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between variables.
3. **Modeling**: Training models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

## Results

The analysis revealed that:
- Parental level of education has a significant impact on test scores.
- Students who completed the test preparation course generally performed better.
- Gender and ethnicity also play roles, although they are less influential compared to parental education and test preparation.

Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the `notebooks` and `reports` directories.
